Access Modifiers
======================

Access modifiers are used to represents the scope of member of class

1) Private
2) default
3) protected
4) Public

1) Public
=========
If we declared any member of class as public then the scope of that member remain throught the project.

2) default
==========
 If we declared any member of class as default then the scope of that member remain only within the Package
 It can't be access from other packages.
 There is no such a keyword to represents default access specifiers.

 3) private
 ==========
 If we declared any member of class as private then scope of that member only within the class
 We can't be access from other classes

 4) protected
 ==============
 If we declared any member of class as protected then the scope of that member remain only within the package.
 In subclasses (even in different packages) using inheritance.



 Note :
 We can't access any property from one project to another project.
 We can't  create class as private because compiler does not give permission
