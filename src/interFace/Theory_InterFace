Interface:
================
It is one of the OOPs Principle .
It is 100% abstract in nature. In interface we can declare only incomplete method in it.


Feature of Interface:
=========================
Data members/variable declared inside interface by default static and final.
Method declared inside interface are by default public and abstract.
Constructor concept not present in interface
By using Interface we achieve multiple inheritance.
To create object of interface programmer need to make use of implementation Class by using Implements keywords.

Implementations Class:
========================
A class which provide definitions for all the incomplete methods which are present in interface with the help
of 'implementations' keyword is called implementation class.
